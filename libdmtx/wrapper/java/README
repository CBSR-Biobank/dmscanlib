README for libdmtx Java wrapper version 0.7.0 - March 2, 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The libdmtx Java wrapper was written by Pete Calvert and is
distributed as part of the libdmtx package.


1. Installing libdmtx Java wrapper on GNU/Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx need not be installed system-wide to build the Java
wrapper, but it does need to be compiled in the grandparent
directory. If using the make command, this and other
prerequisites will be met simply by running:

  $ make

XXX: The openjdk #include path is currently hardcoded in the
     Makefile. Find a portable way to address this
     (openjdk-config equivalent?). In the meantime, users may
     need to modify this line by hand in the Makefile.

To build and run the test programs:

  $ make check
  $ export CLASSPATH=.:$CLASSPATH
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=native:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ javac GUIExample.java
  $ java GUIExample

If you system uses SELinux then you may need to either switch to
Permissive mode, disable it entirely, or assign a security
context that allows Java to load the native/libdmtx.so library.
If any SELinux gurus are reading this, please edit the
documentation wiki (link provided at the bottom of this document)
with the proper method for handling this situation in various
distributions (e.g., Install program? chcon command?)
